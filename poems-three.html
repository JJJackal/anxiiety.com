            The crow calls and crosses the road <br>
            to sit in the shade. She pecks at nothing.<br>
            Bored, not hungry, and with nowhere to be.<br>
            Perhaps anxious under the weight of time.<br><br>
            The nest sits empty. She knows: <br>
            It will grow noisy again. But today, she sighs, <br>
            Calls, and crosses the road to sit in the shade.

        <p class="poem-p">
            This morning I woke one day older<br>
            The ferns curl in, away from me<br>
            Brown dirt greets me in silence – <br>
            I knew my father at this age. <br> 
            We stalked the forest, reveled in its fruit, <br>
            Took its life for ourselves. <br>
            But today I am my own child.<br>
            I will take one hand in the other <br>
            And try to teach myself.

        <p class="poem-p">
            Amid the hickory smoke <br>
            My father taps my beer with his and<br> 
            Recalls his own father, who he likewise fought, <br>
            Who he cussed as I did him, who he <br>
            likewise cared for, who he now weeps over any time <br>
            he sees a semi, tars a roof, shoulders a rifle. <br><br>
            Under the heat and the flies, <br> 
            beneath the skin tanned by Indiana skies, <br>there is a muscle <br>
            that beats and beats and beats
            </p>

            In my dimmer days<br>
            I would curse the buzzsaw, the<br> trucks and stereos,<br>
            The blinking that broke my darkness,<br>
            These alien machines.<br>
            They are not fish,<br>
            Nor fowl. No blood, no chlorophyll,<br> 
            And so they are stupid. Impure.<br><br>
            Today I smile at the popping nailgun.<br>
            In each button and wire: the beauty of nature,<br>
            As in each creature, as in each person,<br>
            A millenia of struggle and work
            </p>

            “(this page is not a poem. It is a reminder-<br>
            ponder: not only works, ink, the act of writing,<br>
            ponder also the paper. The maker of the paper.<br>
            the ink-mixer. Those who craft pens, who carry them to<br>
            the place you buy them, and the person you buy them from.<br>
            The stanzas are no more  enlightening<br>
            than the crease between the pages).”

            Grammar ain’t my strong suit<br>
            but in a distant land<br>
            Beyond the veil of time<br>
            if pages bearing my name<br>
            could be food for hungry insects<br>

            Upon a morning’s repetition<br>

                The dogs in paradise<br>
                Play fetch every moment<br>
                And eat, and eat, and eat<br>

            Once more upon the day<br>
                Live as a dog in heaven-<br>
