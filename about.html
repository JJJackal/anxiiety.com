                <h4 class="cinzel">About me </h4>
                <p class="story-p">I'm a reader first, and always have been. I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and now live in Portland, Oregon. Most of my off-time is spent at the movies, in the park, in the kitchen, or with a book in my hand. </p>
               <h4 class="cinzel"> About Anxiiety.com</h4>
               <p class="story-p"> I've been calling myself a writer for as long as I can remember. But if you were to ask me what I've written, you'd get some noncommital answer about how I had never had anything <i>published</i> exactly, and <i>no,</i> I'd never submitted anything to be considered for publishing. Meaning, unless you came to my house and I handed you a physical copy of something I wrote longhand, you were unlikely to ever see any of my work. All that, and still I called myself a writer. I understand the weird looks I get. When I started building websites, it just made sense for this to be the first one. So: here it is. I finally have something to point to and say, "Look! Proof! I <i>have</i> been doing something besides pacing and feeding the ducks." 
                
                <br><br>

                That being said, I do expect to delve into the world of traditional publishing at some point. Just not today. That is, unless you know somebody who knows somebody.

            <h4 class="cinzel">A note on the Name: Anxiiety</h4>
            <p class="story-p">I made a typo in a text message once and just really like the way it looks on the page. <br><br> On a more serious note, I feel that we are the most anxious generation to ever live. Not just because of the state of the world, but also because we have a view of everything, all the time, from every possible angle, and you can't help but be miserable when you're that aware.</p>
